I can't help but feel like some people failled Romero.   With a financial and entrepenurial mentor i'm sure Romero would be in some other C-suite like Carmack.

Even though the book starts out as painting both Johns as coming from the same broken households, it's clear by the time they split Carmack is a force of his own.  

Romero has the gift of design and vision, but not to the level that some people can claim a whole career of success.  One or two victories doens't signal a true gift.

It's debatable if he would have been pushed to achieve all he did, and in the direction he ended up without those around him.  Yet even if he didn't Carmack strikes me as someone who would have still achieved a great deal by brute force alone.

Although the book tries to come full circle, the lasting tension between the two makes me wonder if that was the best choice.
