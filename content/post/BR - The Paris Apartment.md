Another mystery book tried, another reminder i'm not a big fan.  I'm not suggesting the book was bad - In fact "the twist" were quite shocking.  But I constantly have this gnawing feeling of "just get on with it!".  Maybe that's just considered being suspenseful and suggests it's a great book?  Like Jess i'll just keep rushing head first into danger (read books) and hope the best just works out.
