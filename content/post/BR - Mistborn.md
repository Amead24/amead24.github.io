Author: Brandon Sanderson

Everything in this was fantastic.  The character development of Vin from a girl to a confident women or Kelsier's conflict between his ego and the revolution, a realistic example of when you might want a vanguard party vs. mass popular upheaval, and finally the completely unique magic system that feels like it's in it's own place of hard vs. fantasy science fiction.

This was a masterpiece - Can't wait to read and write more about this guy's work.
