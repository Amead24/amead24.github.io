This might have been one of the funnest books i've read in the past year.  Sometimes the Gods announced themselves, or were easily identified.  Other times you had to think deeply, picture the scene, and make an educated guess.  Like a really engaging textbook, I found myself finishing a chapter and then reading about random Irish mythology all night.  The boring lives everyone leads mixed in with once all mighty gods makes ones imagination run rampant.  For example, as we passed through the barren, but beautiful, South West and we'd stop at a diner or gas station hundreds of miles away from the closest town, I couldn't help but wonder if the server or attendant was some ancient forgotten Navajo or Apache God.

Especially as an American, it's interesting to wonder about other cultures.  Do they still practice their rituals, prayers, and XXX or have the American Gods gone global?

Notes on the unlikely back story of Shadow -

And just like Shadow, i'm traveling across America seeing the signs about runner up state qualifiers or 4th place state poets.
