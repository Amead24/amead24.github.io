My experience seems to mimic that of the many other reviews i've read.  Besides the blantant mysogany, heterosexism, and nauseating paragraphs of Jubal's opinion taken as fact, the plot is a fairly basic critique of organized relgion and monogamy, which when taken by itself is not even that interesting.

I think he deserves some credit for attempting to build a future that doesn't seem unrealistic at all sixty years later.  Tension, that emerges out of an idiocracy, between the world governments and powerful hyper-commericialized relgions.  Yet only a fraction of the book is dedicated to this concept, there's a brief discussion between the Federations leader and his wife about manipulating the Man from Mars for their own gain in controlling opposing factions before discorporating into a critique of astrology.  I'm not exadurating, a few chapters later the main characters have a meeting involving many world leaders where it's reveled to be all meaningless because the real deal was done over paperwork ahead of time.  The only interesting geo-political side story involving a war between Mars and Earth is immediately brushed under the rug with a bluff, where any normal reader might think will come back to haunt the protaganist, but alas Jubal is too cunning and firm to be duped, until he is when a lady cries on his chest because he won't sleep with her.

What takes the place of this futuristic libertarian hell-scape?  A pornographic x-men cult.  Mike the Martian having learned the martian language, is able to tap into the true cosmic order of things and control things or even whisk them out of existance with only his mind.  

This goes unexplained, but it's sci-fy so we give it the benefit of the doubt, ultimately though it turns out to be eastern religion with a heavy dose ofwestern thought. (??)

By meditating, slowing down, seeking wisdom, and most importantly a lot of heterosexual group sex one can unlock these powers.  Once the main female protaganist, with the help of Mike, accepts the inate female need for flaunting her sexuality they both start a sex cult.  This involves suckering "marks" into paying for wisdom until they reach a certain level which they can then sleep with other members in a hidden temple called "the Nest", complete with shared finances, cleaing, and cooking.

This turned out to be a huge let down.  Starship troopers was a fun read, and I thought this would be the same.  The book and reviews both sold "an inspiration" for the counter culture of the 60's.  Maybe most did become Jubal - sexist, creepy, libertarians.
