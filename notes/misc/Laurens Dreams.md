09/12/2020 - I think I was in conneaut's college with mystery people, guy and girl.  we rode our bikes to the school but got lost looking for my bike - mystery guy gave me a ride in their truck and it ended up being a snow storm.  while going up and down a moutain (feelings of impeding death) I saw a goose flying upside down with it's neck bent backwards?  there might have been a bar that I feel asleep during?  **feelings of reoccuring getting lost in conneat college**
