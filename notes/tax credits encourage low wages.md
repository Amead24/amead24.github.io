another form of [[corporate welfare]] includes tax credits for individuals making little income, which then allows for companies to offset higher wages by encouraging their employees to seek out gvoernment aid.

Unions are stuck in a hard place then when pushing for higher wages that would take someone off their handouts which are of a greater value than the increased wage.  One might counter that getting off the government's payroll should be enough, that's just another [[neo-liberalism]] contradiction for when [[using the system when you're poor is bad, but encouraged when you're rich]].
