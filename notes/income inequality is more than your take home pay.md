traditional income inequality measures only economic inequality, that is, the difference between your take home pay and what you need to survive or thrive.  meanwhile factors such as social inequality goes un-reported further exerbating the problem.  one can think of social inequality as the rewards from the Commons: public transportation, parks, social services, and schooling to name a few.

solving income inequality by privatizing public goods then could leave someone in a net negative position.
