Oil and gas are a laughable [[neo-liberalism]] idea of a free-market not only making it near impossible for alternative energy companies to compete in the marketplace but directly contribute to low prices of fuel encouraging more consumption.

A counter argument would be that pushing gas prices low helps the poor and removing them would be regressive.  That could still be true, but one has to wonder what $550b in investment to alternative energy could provide.  Alternative energy is already pushing cost effective even in a world of the subsidies and we havn't even factored in the price of externalities (pollution).


"According to the IEA, these came to $550 billion world wide in 2014, four times the subsidy for renewable energy.  It estimated that scrapping them would cut carbon emissions by a fifth"
