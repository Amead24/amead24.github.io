Charitable deductions can be a form of [[regressive taxation]].

For those who can afford to make more donations than the standard deduction while also using a loose definition of charity to make contributions to special interests groups.  Those tend to have high ROI as they can lobby for better rules to propel long term growth.  Lastly these contributions deprive the public of the ability to have democratic control over potential tax dollars.
