due to c19, a lot of household savings were stashed away.  with the re-opening economy that number is expected to rise exponentially.

secondly low income individuals are saving, reducing debts (less fees and interest payments).

both of these mean that as spending ramps up, supply chains frozen for the past year will be ill-equipped to supply demand.

on top of that the labor shortage is forcing wages up.

lastly, talk of inflation is up.  perception drives reality?

All of this means that the low inflation, and cheap cost of capital, has pushed no-profit companies to ramp up debt and increase growth.  The shift will hit those the hardest.

reading capital papers by hedge funds reads like a fuck the inept government paper, no wonder these people leave it to lobbyists.


meanwhile investors are pushing up the price of commodities due to instability and uneasiness with the existing federal monetary policy 

repo market involves overnight securities sales,
reverse repo market involves guaranteed selling of those securities in the morning

Currently the liquidity in the US stock market is entirely artificial because the fed won't stop brrrrr because **the slightest bit of federal tapering could shut down the entire game. it's either no more bananas for anyone, or so many bananas that the value of bananas becomes near worthless.**

**No bananas, no liquidity.**

Wat mean? Means there is too much cash in the system and not enough collateral (like treasury bonds). It means there's an imbalance between dollars (which are essentially IOUs) and whatever is backing the dollar's worth.
