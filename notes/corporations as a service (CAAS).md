If a corporation/firm is thought of as a serivce then wall street and trading firms can be though of as the infrastructure/cloud provider.  Lawyers and bankers create corporations to serve very specific purposes.  **Some can be backend services, in that they serve a stateful purpose of making profits.  Others might be more ephemeral services that are to play a more defensive role (see SPV).** 

As the ease of globalization increases firms can be thought of as an asset.  Maybe their legal, regulatory, or location has value in and of itself.  Capitalists can use this form of [[asymetric information can be exploited for profit | regulatory arbitrage]] to make money that is seperate from the function (for example producing widgets) of the firm itself.

also like most SaaS platforms the claim is that the money saving is in the abstraction of labor.  all the messy parts have been pushed out to third party firms, automation fillls the other third, and the last third is those essential workers who are perpetually living contract to contract, and or training/documenting their roles to make it easier to replace them

the firm then becomes a sort of value extraction function to be placed over geographical regions or groups of exploited labor
