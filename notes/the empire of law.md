law follows a predictable pattern where domestic law can trigger conflict laws, and/or international law allowing skilled lawyers to pick and choose which rules apply to a given asset.

secondly many states allow parties to opt into foreign law, and then enforce it locally meaning the entire power of the state can be mobilized to enforce gains that they won't even see in tax revenue.

ultimately it allows skilled capitalists/lawyers to operate almost independently of any particular "home" nation.  The losers are those local communities who don't benefit from companies in their backyard and even further labor movements who have to identify trans-national actors to reign in excesses of capital.
