Thinking in Systems, Meadows 2008

Flows both in and out of systems.  These systems 'stock' up resources, and then those can be managed in limited way to make the flows operate independently of each other.  

Example: An economy that has resources going in, factories making goods, and goods going out.  Without stock control we'd make at the point of consumption.  Secodnly creating more factories or policies take awhile to change the 'stock', creating a lag in feedback.
