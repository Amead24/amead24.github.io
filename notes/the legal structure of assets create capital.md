Financial assets are only valuable because of the enforcement of contract enabled by law.  For other assets that represent physical goods Pistor argues that the legal coding elevates it to a status of capital.  

These properties carry additional value than the underlying asset birthing capital. The four major legal categories are:
1. priority - Trusts example? 
2. durability
3. convertability
4. universality

Thanks to [[the empire of law]] assets that have been properly codified can take on additional properties and be enforced universally.
