An example of a firm that hires data scientists and engineers to predict empty boxes and trigger a warning for worker intervention.

After several weeks mgmt checks the alarm data to find none have triggered recently.  See "checking your assumptions"

After some investigation it turned out that the workers having gotten sick of hearing the alarm put a fan in front of the assembly line.  See "manual interventions should be automated".
