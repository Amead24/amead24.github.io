Bishop has a reasonable problem with one super individual, Homelander.  However he's generalized the target from one Supe to all of them.  When he meet's Huey who also has a reasonable problem with one super individual, A-Train, conflicts ensues as he isn't willing to condemn them all as terrible people.

Heuy is still willing to see that the world isn't that black and white, that not everyone is the same, and absolutes lead to the dark side.
