Like the snake that eats its' own tail, capitalism has grown so large that it's started to extract profits from things to come, profits to be materialized, that when the time comes to actually make those profits we're going to realize that it's a giant ponzi scheme, that we've borrowed from peter to pay paul.  

Rising asset prices allow for more individuals who are not seeing wage growth take out more debt to finance a better future for themselves.  In aggregate asset prices rise again and the cycle continues.  The middle class then has made financial gain on the back of a bubble through non-liquid assets meaning that when it pops they left with nothing but a large amount of debt and no way to make even the interest payment.  Meanwhile investors who, rarely, even lost money from the bubble get to collect fees, interest payments, or collateral for pennies on the dollar.

"If the logic of capitalism is based on extraction from people and planet today, then finance-led growth is based on extraction from people and planet today and tomorrow, until the future itself has been stolen."
Blakely, Grace.  Stolen. pg 23
