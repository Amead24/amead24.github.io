There's a lot of moving pieces to keep track of in such an industry and it'll be hard to break down a large community project into smaller actionable pieces when so much relies on other individuals.

Bill suggested that it's a mix of both.  That those with leadership abilities who are in positions of activism do well, but also that some people can rise to the challenge when it is thrust upon them.  There might also be some community support that goes out to those with the momentary political capital to capitalise on.
