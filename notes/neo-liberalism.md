Why can we exist in a world where one firm controls everything and that's considered total freedom, but to live in one where we have conflict between unions and firms isn't considered freedom?

The more interesting question is not so much how they can have some strange acrobatic logic, but instead where where does the idea of freedom originate from such that the firm should be completely unregulated?  Ultimately we need to reject the framework that starts with that freedom as a premise.



preference for a "unregulated" market but condemn unions for being anti-competitive.

In most of the world liberalism means to liberate from regulation, but in the US we call them libertarians.  Those who promote unfettered capitalism combine with a small US government.  Neo-liberalism takes this one step further and uses a larger state to restrict any sort of attempt to put chains on capitalism whether it be better individual freedoms (workplace discrimination) or anti-union activities.
