Urban legend suggests that nasa spent millions for a space pen when they could have used a pencil.  Critics use this to suggest that you shouldn't over engineer a solution, to me it signifies that most people don't understand the level of the problem.  Graphite flying around or combustion of a wooden pen in 100% oxygen.  

If it was so easy it would have been done by now?

Also Fisher spent over a million of his own dollars to create a pen and sold them to nasa for 3$.  That's public service at it's finest.
