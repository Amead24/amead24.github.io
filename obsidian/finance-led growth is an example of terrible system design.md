Keynes would have argued -

Capitalism requires [[Keynes argues that the government needs to be counter-cyclical | careful counter-cyclical maitenance ]] in order to provide an improved standard of living.

It requires the attention of hundreds if not thousands of dedicated beuracrats and professionals all of which are suseptible to the same human condition as the rest of us.  On top of that they have to constatnly beat back attacks from lobbists who work to degrade the implemented measures.  Lastly all of them can be out weighted by the single decision of a few policy makers.

From a computer science perspective it lacks significant redundancy rests on a few single points of failure, and has no self-correcting mechanisms.
