An good friend of mine once shared with me something she had heard or read that went something like this, "the Republican party is the greatest con in history, they've convinced millions of people to vote against their own self-interest".  We were talking about "deep" ideas nearing the end of our senior year while chain smoking in the woods between debate rounds, a standard passage into adult hood.

At the time I chalked it up to no one wants to be seen as poor, or taking a government handout.  There's no doubt that's apart of it, rugged individualism for the poor socialism for the rich!  Yet millions of people are familiar with, go to work, to school, or even love someone who depends on some form of a government program.  Why then do these people vehemently oppose universal child care or abolishing tutition debt but rarely lift a finger when trillions are given in tax breaks to the top one percent?  

Only as I got older and started being encouraged to take my finances into my own hands did I realize that economic policy is extremely boring.  One could argue that from a public relations standpoint the Right does a better job hiding their corporate handouts.  The left is usually seen as standing against those bills that also adjust a tax credit giving the poor and working class an extra hundred bucks at the end of the year.  Ultimately they appear out of touch and unwilling to "actually" help people.  No matter how boring economic policy is though, the discussion of abolishing capital gains taxes, free trade and de-regulation is as loud as ever.

Well this long lost memory came crashing back to me as Grace Blakely elegantly answers this question and more in ***Stolen: How to Save the World from Financialization***.   First she explains how near the end of 1980's with the collapse of international agreements on regulation and gold based currency, financial markets were opened up around the world.  What followed was an explosion of monied interests that used their stockpiles of wealth to lobby for more power.  As laws loosened economies started depending more and more on financialization to keep profits higher than ever.  This shift she calls finance-led growth and can be traced back to a myriad of problems.  

For starters finance-led growth encourages privitization of everything.  Contrary to popular belief that the only government handouts to individuals is welfare Blakely explains how Thatcher used the privitization of national programs to essentially give free money to middle class individuals which then go on to vote for her party.  "[T]the privatisiation of the UK's social housing stock, which was sold off and not repalced . . . began to rise at a faster rate than the increasin the housing stock, and house prices skyrocketed.  Newly created asset owners found themselves the recipients of windfalls in the form of capital gains" (pg 91).  Unfortunately the sell offs tend to hurt the poor the hardest as they recieve worse public services despite being a more commonly associated ally in the fight for better living conditions.

The privization doesn't end just at public services though.  Pensions need to be liquified and injected in the capitalist bloodstream and thus individuals are encouraged to become their own "mini-capitalists" by adopting 401ks or investing in stocks.  The end result is that middle class interests become loosely aligned deregulation and lower capital gains taxes.  Rich asset owners who tend to have a large chunk of their wealth find a large voting block to help them keep the same bought politicians in power.

I'm reminded about a time in an intro to feminism class I had to take at college.  When discussion the portrayal of women in media, someone suggested that men were not treated equally either, they're often the bumbling idiot who can't even work a dishwasher.  The teacher asked well then who does the dishes?  To which everyone replied the woman.  The point being that when analyzing media or policy one shouldn't take it on face value and instead ask who benefits the most.  Blakely does a fantastic job at explaining not just why, but how, the middle class came to vote for the new neoliberal agenda.  On face the statement is flawed, they do, in fact, stand to gain some by standing with the ultra-rich.  However with a little more critical thought, it quickly becomes apparent that the upper class gains a significantly more than the middle class does.  And all that translates to a smaller piece of the pie to share between more mouths.
