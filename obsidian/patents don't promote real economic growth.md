A function of [[rentier capitalism]] where by the State allows for bullshit patents that rarely produce any economic gain, thus [[finance-led growth is unsustainable | hurting free market innovation and competition]].

"A Carnegie Institue survey of why firms chose to patent showed that only 10 percent of patents had real economic value; the rest were filed to ensure a monopoly or to block potential litigation, that is, for rent-seeking purposes."
Standing, Guy.  Corruption of Capitalism, pg. 54.
