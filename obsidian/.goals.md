theres a progression from moving from having base feelings of happiness to happiness to ideas of "being better" even if it means short term suffering

then one might want to have a greater long term aspirations, however these require varying degrees of long term planning as one needs to break them down into smaller easier to acomplish goals

however those long term goals require a very deep sense of introspection to understand what you value more than momentary happiness.  this becomes a recursive problem where one might suffer their entire life in pursuit of a singular goal.

what are helpful questions to arrive at those long term goals?

***what do I want out of life, and then work backwards to figure out how to get there.***
