**Long term planning is hard.**

Long term planning causes long-term discomfort that requires discipline, adaptability and organization to overcome. Breaking larger parts into smaller pieces is an iterative process. Even then you might not understand the extent to which some “smaller” goal is still too abstract and several steps away until you get started on it.

  

In those situations an individual needs to be flexible enough to change the original smaller goal. A balance is needed to avoid sunk cost fallacy versus succumbing to an easier target when the original is doable.

Why are amorphous objectives painful? There’s the immediate problem that they’re hard to solve, they require constant recursive iteration into smaller problems that alone isn’t obvious, sometime those end up being hard problems in and of themselves. 

  

There’s also a large loss of control in these large projects, no one controls all the pieces.

  

A not insignificant amount of the work is around project organization, which may or may not be your strong suit. Another level of personal organization is also required to prioritize and be open to changing priorities as the situation changes. My desire for someone to provide a solution

Thanks, I was just reflecting on the totality of the one on ones we've had.  Something that appears a lot is uncertainty and change.  Our work doesn't have a hard direction ("science of pricing"), project management and driving larger solutions has a lot of flexibility to it ("what's the goal of PI"), and even in my personal life I flip-flop on what I want because it requires long-term planning which is notoriously chaotic ("mastery vs. problem-solving").  

I really appreciate the effort you've put into these one on ones.

Action and adaptability as a crux for long term planning. See basement for adaptability

I need some way to keep myself accountable to my long term plans.
