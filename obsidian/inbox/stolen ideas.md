Phillips curve - an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation.
As unemployment went up people stop spending as much, thus slowing the economy and inflation.  When inflation rises currency goes further and thus more people are needed to fill manufactoring demand.

Why don't unions pool together their money and buy pieces of a company?  Use their pension in the same way as "activitist investors" do.

Thatcher used the privitization of national programs to essentially give free money to middle class individuals.  They then go on to vote conservative.  Hypocritically this is what they level against leftists of doing, buying votes with handouts when their own parties do it to just in another (sometimes less obvious) way.

As middle class tends to own a large chunk of their wealth in material or financial assets.  For example then when the State privatizes bussing causing taxes to go down those asset owners will then recieve a "free" handout.  They then lost free transportation, and on top of it hurt their fellow citizens.

		"In the UK, much of this debt was used ot purchase housing, made available through the privatisiation of the UK's social housing stock, which was sold off and not repalced.  The amount of money directing into the housing market began to rise at a faster rate than the increasin the housing stock, and house prices skyrocketed. ^8 Newly created asset owners found themselves the recipients of windfalls in the form of capital gains.  Rather than relying on wage increases to support their living standards, this new group of homeowners came to rely on rising house prices, aligning their matieral interests with asset owners rather than other wage-earners, and seucring their support for the status quo."

Unfortunately they would have a stronger ally below them, rather than trying to identify with those above them.

The shift from pensions to 401k birthed thousands of "capitalists" which had to learn a bit about finance to provide for themselves.  This in term fostered a sense of individualism with their money and future such that they then were willing to promote regulations and reforms that helped the market. 

"The State privitized Keynes-ism" by abjucating their role in being the counter-cyclical agents of the economy.   They asked individuals to do so
by making individuals act as their own counter-cyclical agents by using debt to weather the busts.  This in turn resulted in a profit for financial institutions who collect money from fees, transactions, data, and interest.

With all their spare time, the State shifted it's focus instead on making the booms bigger without regard for what the busts would look like.  They supercharged the financial crisis so a few could get richer and left the middle class out to dry.  Over a trillion dollars in tax cuts were handed out to the rich and powerful while nurses struggled to secure PPE during a global pandemic.

"The state's role would be limited to controlling inflation, which might hurt the value of your assets and hard earned savings, by controlling interest rates."
Blakely, Grace.  Stolen. pg. 110

"A transfer of society's resources from those who work for a living to those who own the assets."
Blakely, Grace.  Stolen.  Pg. 110

"co-opting middle earners by turning them into mini-capitalists and creating a marginalised class of poorly-paid, precarious, and heavily indebted workers beneath them."
Blakely, Grace.  Stolen.  Pg 110

What does the shift in shareholder ideology have to do with transnational capitalism, or vise versa?  The increasing power of shareholders that rose out of financialization allows for them to then become activist investors, corporate raiders, or White Knights.  They then go on to buy lobbying power with the government, creating a self-fulling prophecy.  Ultimately the State enshrines a corporations legal obligation to maximize shareholder value and shareholders work to make sure that that means stock price an not increasing workers wages or benefits.

There's never a clear singular right answer though, at the same time the power from the bottom was weakened around the 1970s when stagflation blew up the Philips Curve.  See Aftermath for a breakdown of the dissolution of workers power.

"States would degregulate financial markets, making investors more powerful, thereby allowing governments to invoke the logic of market competition to justify their imposition of neoliberal policies on unwilling populace."
