for individuals who don't qualify for more than the standard deduction they gain nothing at all from tax breaks, but ultimately the more income you have the more you gain in tax breaks.

the seven most common personal tax breaks:
health insurance
mortage interest
pension plans
EITC
SALT
charity
social security benefits

"The US GAO has calculated that tax breaks reduce the official 35 per cent corporation tax to an actual rate of 13 per cent, saving corporations $200b annually."
