Abstractions make designing complex systems easier, with Python everything is fundamentally an PyObject.  This makes designing the next layer of abstrations easier (CPython).  Extensibility here then becomes easier as a middle man can design for the expected inputs and outputs and ignore all the rest, do highly optimized languages write their own CPython extensions then, or are they working in this middle ground?

Allowing users to interact with the lower level abstraction makes it harder to update or change that abstraction.


Python has optimized for this very complex world it has setup.  Like the shipping containers analogy Taking Smart Notes, inertia has pushed the developers to a place where they're solving the XY problem constantly.


Complexity analysis sounds like a business topic, but becomes interesting after having many examples or experience with it.  Then it becomes a deeply "technical" subject to talk about.
