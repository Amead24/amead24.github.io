Machine learning as a service

"manage data, train, evaluate, deploy models, make predictions and moitor predictions"

Realize this becomes a problem when you have a bunch of one off systems popping up.  Ideally you would like to reduce the amount of rework, and create reproducable pipelines.  In the same way CICD, or IAC, arose out of the many problems that can arise through a whole process - Is there a way we can streamline this into a codified solution?

Once we can, then you can centralize SME into refining the tool to allow for a multiplicative bonus to all who use it.

Managing data (feature store)
In order to empower training, testing, and deployment to have a consistent data access, schema, and statistics a feature store is used.
