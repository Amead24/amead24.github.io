Studies have shown that on average a short term memory can only juggle between four and seven ideas and that anything above this needs to be either forgotten or externalized (ideally into writing).  </p>

<p>The one caveat though is that writing things down is as good as actually doing them.  Hence the reason an efficent organization system is needed to make sure that once you've purged them from your memory you either get them done or never lose the idea.</p>

<p>When one has dozens of smaller little things flowing through their mind it, a signficant amount of overhead is lost to keeping the jobs in memory and keeping their relations (like a DAG) together.  Only by collecting them together, organizing them, and making decisions can one dedicate themselves fully to action.</p>

<p>"What we can take from Allen as an insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective.  Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent."<br />
