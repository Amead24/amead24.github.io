<div id="content"><p>We promote tax breaks on companies for repaying their debt? </p>

<p>Not only is it directly lost money for a state, but one has to wonder why a company would need an extra incentive to pay of their debt, when the interest is supposed to do that for them?   Appears to be a contradiction of outcomes as interest encourages one to prolong the loan if the value of the debt outweighs the repayment, while tax breaks encourage one to repay and discount.</p>

<p>Is that a win-win for a corporation then?  If the value of the debt is worth less than the interest payment, then they can pay it off and get reimbursed by the state while if the value of the debt is worth more than the interest payment, they make a profit.</p>
