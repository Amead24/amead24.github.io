<p><strong>_The total complexity of a system is a constant. If you make a user’s interaction with a system simpler, the complexity behind the scenes increases._</strong></p>

<p><strong>_Complexity might not always need to be farthest from the users._</strong></p>

<p><strong>_Complexity should be where you want it. If you’re designing a tool for developers you might want a lot of flags if it makes sense for the tool, versus for an analyst you would want sane defaults._</strong> </p>

<p><strong>_Even then, some complexity is necessary to make users feel comfortable:_</strong></p>
