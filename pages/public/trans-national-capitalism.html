<div id="content"><p>Before 1980's you have the dissolution of the Bretton Wood pact, and once currency is freed from a material good - fiat is born.  An army of <a href="neo-liberalism">neo-liberalism</a> advocates followed and with it a transcendance of the nation state to the international marketplace.</p>

<p>This makes democratic accountability and localized union activity significantly more difficult if not non-existant.  If a company can move production oversees for less than the cost of a unionized workforce, they will do it, and if a government is more worried about the taxes or kickbacks from that company disapearing than representing their constitutents then they will allow it to happen.</p>

<p><a href="trans-national-capitalism">Trans-national capitalism</a> really grew out of the 1980s and 1990s where we saw a push between the IMF, WTO, OECD and dozens of other smaller financial institutions to increase the flow of labor, reduce spending on public goods, and privatize natural resources for foreign investment.  </p>

<p>These governing bodies then leverage predatory loans on smaller countries (see <a href="shock-doctrine">shock doctrine</a>) for further austerity.  When the busts of capitalism inevitably come along like these countries are further hampered in restructuing their economies to help the working class.</p>

<p>With a countries <a href="solving-income-inequality-requires-more-than-good-paying-jobs">solving income inequality requires more than good paying jobs</a> already gutted <a href="income-inequality-is-more-than-your-take-home-pay">income inequality is more than your take home pay</a> flourishes making bribery easier, black markets spring up and inflation rises as more and more wealth is siphoned off to foreign investment.  Post Soviet states and those throughout Latin America are testimate to the effects of structural adjustments.   See <a href="crony-capitalism">crony capitalism</a>.</p>

<p>Compare this to the Socialist alternative whereby the working class nationalize parts of the industry and use that money to help provide for a base line of services.  These then become a safety net to prevent further degregation, effectively reversing the downward spiral.</p>
