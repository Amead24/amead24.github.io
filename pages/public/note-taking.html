<div id="content"><p>note taking in and of itself won't be extremely helpful, however when attempting to write an essay or article they can be useful in chaining thoughts together.  If that's a goal then working backwards through your existing Obsidian notes can be helpful to follow a train of thought. </p>

<p>Conversely Andy talks about the opposite directionless form of writing where ideas or topics spring up naturally through sustained daily note taking.  </p>

<p><strong>Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims</strong><br />

<p>When writing Evergreen notes, I’ve found that using complete phrases as note titles helps maintain concept-orientation (Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented). For example: Educational objectives often subvert themselves, Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”).</p>

<p>These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics (contra Evergreen notes should be atomic). In both cases, the solution is to break the ideas down and write about the bits I understand best first.</p>

<p>Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter. Some questions really are evergreen (To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?); others are more ephemeral creative prompts (How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?). The goal with the latter type of note is to eventually drop the question mark, refactoring it into declarative/imperative notes.</p>

<p>A few common exceptions to this policy:</p>

<pre><code>I use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: Executable strategy, Enacted experience, Enabling environment
Outline notes (see Create speculative outlines while you write) like §Note-writing systems
For more, see Taxonomy of note types
</code></pre>

<p>I often begin by writing a note without knowing what the title will be. The title often emerges from the text as it’s written. When a note suggests a strong title with a clear claim, that’s a good sign that it’s starting to make sense. Related: Evergreen note titles are like APIs</p>

<p>Note taking has to be careful to avoid the trees for the forest, when highlighting or underlining you might be getting factual information but unless you translate the idea that the medium is trying to convey you're still going to have to do the thinking and writing piece later.  And that, is not the goal.  However facts will eventually be needed for writing reference pieces so finding a good balance to get your point across without hoarding them is key to making sure your note taking is useful.</p>
