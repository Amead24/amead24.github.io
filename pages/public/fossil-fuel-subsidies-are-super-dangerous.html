Alternative energy is already pushing cost effective even in a world of the subsidies and we havn't even factored in the price of externalities (pollution).</p>

<p>"According to the IEA, these came to $550 billion world wide in 2014, four times the subsidy for renewable energy.  It estimated that scrapping them would cut carbon emissions by a fifth"<br />
