<div id="content"><p><a href="tax-subsidies-overview">tax subsidies overview</a> and <a href="trans-national-capitalism">Trans-national capitalism</a> show how countries compete in a race to the bottom to allow better exploitation of their own laws and regulations by corporations all the while creating detailed, obtusive, and draconian laws surrounding the poor or working class to recieve meager benefits.  </p>

<p>In large part this is due to the complicated nature of how corporations recieve  welfare compared to a direct check from the federal government.  It'd be a lie though that this wasn't intentionally weaponized in anyway.</p>
