Ruby - Day 1

**1. Print the string “Hello, world.”**
```
puts "hello world!"
==> hello world!
```

**2. For the string “Hello, Ruby,” find the index of the word “Ruby.”**
```
"hello ruby".index("ruby")
==> 6
```

• Print your name ten times.
• Print the string “This is sentence number 1,” where the number 1
changes from 1 to 10.
• Run a Ruby program from a file.
• Bonus problem: If you’re feeling the need for a little more, write
a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the
number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
(Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and
gets will read a string from the keyboard that you can translate to
an integer.)
